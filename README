UT804 digital multimeter manufactured by UNI-T Group Limited. Model UT804 has
RS232 interface that allows to recieve measurment results. Software provided by
manufacturer works only with microsoft based operating systems, so I prepare
simple program for linux users. Most protocol reengineerd was done thanks to
UT804.LOG I found in the Internet (no link, sorry).
